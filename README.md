## Overview

This visual novel presents the Council of Chalcedon as a documentary-style experience. No player choices - just history unfolding through the actual words of the participants.

The council defined the orthodox understanding of Christ's two natures (divine and human) united in one person, rejecting both Nestorianism and Monophysitism.
